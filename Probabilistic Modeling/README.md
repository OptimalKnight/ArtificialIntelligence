# Probabilistic Modeling

This project focuses on solving three distinct problems:

1. **Probabilistic Height Distribution Estimation:**
   - Using Gibbs Sampling to estimate individual height distributions of men and women in a combined dataset.
   - Implementing a Gibbs Sampler to visualize the convergence of component means (μ0, μ1) over 1000 samples.
   - Plotting histograms of heights assigned to each component and tracking the evolution of π.

2. **Particle Filter for Robot Localization:**
   - Designing a Particle Filter algorithm to localize a robot in an unknown city using sensor data.
   - Implementing random movements for the robot and updating particle positions based on sensor likelihood.
   - Creating a heatmap to visually represent the probability distribution across the grid.

3. **MDP-based X-Men Strategy:**
   - Formulating a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model Wolverine's attempt to rescue Jean from Magneto.
   - Implementing both Value Iteration and Policy Iteration algorithms for two versions of Magneto (lazy and active).
   - Visualizing the MDP board and optimal policy graphically.
