# Puzzles and Probabilistic Modeling

This repository hosts two projects:

1. **AI for Puzzle Games:**

   - Wooden Block Stacking, Adversarial Board Game, and Wordoku Solver.
   - Explores various AI algorithms, including minimax, search algorithms, and CSP.

2. **Probabilistic Modeling:**

   - Gibbs Sampling for Height Distribution Estimation, Particle Filter for Robot Localization, and MDP-based X-Men Strategy.
   - Focuses on probabilistic modeling techniques for diverse scenarios.

For detailed information, refer to individual project folders.
