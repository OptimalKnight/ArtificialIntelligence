# AI for Puzzle Games

This project focuses on solving three distinct problems:

1. **Wooden Block Stacking:**

   - Implemented Breadth-First Search, Depth-Frist Search, Uniform Cost Search, Iterative Deepening Search, A\* Search, and Iterative Deepening A\* Search algorithms to find a path for the wooden block stacking problem.
   - Evaluated performance based on the number of nodes explored and the time taken for execution.
   - Tested each algorithm for different number of blocks.

2. **Adversarial Board Game:**

   - Implemented `max_value()` and `min_value()` methods using the minimax algorithm for Player moves.
   - Developed `ai_move_logic()` using minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
   - Extended the implementation to a 4x4 board.

3. **Wordoku Solver:**

   - Implemented a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) approach to solve Wordoku puzzles.
   - Utilized backtracking search with constraint propagation to fill the grid with alphabets based on constraints.
   - Implemented the `Min_Conflict` search algorithm for efficient solving.
